# Road System Implementation - Prioritized Tasks

## High Priority (Critical Path)

1. **Texture Rendering Issues**
   - Diagnose why textures load but don't display
   - Fix `colorSpace` configuration for asphalt texture
   - Ensure proper material configuration for Three.js meshes

2. **Debug Visualization Fixes**
   - Investigate why red spheres (end connection markers) aren't visible
   - Fix coordinate space issues between road segments and debug elements
   - Ensure debug elements are properly positioned relative to the rotated road plane

3. **Coordinate Space Standardization**
   - Document proper 3D coordinate usage (XZ plane for ground, Y for height)
   - Validate mesh rotation and orientation against world coordinates
   - Create consistent coordinate handling across components

## Medium Priority

1. **Road Integration with Game Scene**
   - Replace placeholder grid with functional road network
   - Update camera system to follow road curves
   - Implement player movement constraints to keep on roads

2. **Visual Improvements**
   - Add fallback mechanisms for missing textures
   - Implement z-ordering fixes for overlapping elements
   - Add road markings and details

3. **Testing Tools**
   - Set up visual validation tools for road segments
   - Create diagnostic views for road connection debugging
   - Implement togglable debug modes

## Lower Priority

1. **Collision System**
   - Implement basic collision boundaries for roads
   - Create road boundary visualization in debug mode
   - Add player-road collision detection

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize texture loading and caching
   - Implement instanced rendering for repeated elements
   - Set up performance benchmarks for road system

## Blocked Tasks (Waiting on Prior Items)

- Complex course layout (blocked by coordinate space standardization)
- Advanced road features (blocked by texture rendering fixes)
- Dynamic road elements (blocked by debug visualization fixes)

## Task Dependencies

Texture Rendering → Debug Visualization → Coordinate Space → Road Integration

Visual Improvements     Testing Tools     Collision System
         ↓                     ↓                 ↓
                   Performance Optimization
```

## Implementation Notes

1. Focus on fixing the core rendering issues before adding new features
2. Use TypeScript strict typing for all components and utilities
3. Follow React Three Fiber best practices for 3D object hierarchy
4. Document all coordinate space decisions in code comments
5. Use the debug mode toggle (D key) for testing changes
