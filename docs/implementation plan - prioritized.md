# Road System Implementation - Prioritized Tasks

## High Priority (Critical Path) - Partially Completed ✅

1. **Texture Rendering Issues** - [Mostly Resolved ✅]
   - ✅ Fixed texture loading and path resolution system
   - ✅ Implemented proper `colorSpace` configuration (SRGBColorSpace)
   - ✅ Added fallback texture generation for missing files
   - ⚠️ Final verification needed across different environments

2. **Debug Visualization Fixes** - [In Progress ⚠️]
   - ⚠️ Continue investigating positioning of red spheres (end connection markers)
   - ⚠️ Standardize coordinate handling between road segments and debug elements
   - ✅ Added TextureDebugger and StandaloneTextureDebugger components

3. **Coordinate Space Standardization** - [Needs Focus 🔍]
   - ⚠️ Document proper 3D coordinate usage (XZ plane for ground, Y for height)
   - ⚠️ Validate mesh rotation and orientation against world coordinates
   - ⚠️ Create consistent coordinate handling across components

## Medium Priority - Partially Implemented

1. **Road Integration with Game Scene** - [Not Started ⏳]
   - Replace placeholder grid with functional road network
   - Update camera system to follow road curves
   - Implement player movement constraints to keep on roads

2. **Visual Improvements** - [Partially Implemented ✅⚠️]
   - ✅ Added fallback mechanisms for missing textures (canvas-based)
   - ⚠️ Need to implement z-ordering fixes for overlapping elements
   - ✅ Added procedural road markings for different segment types

3. **Testing Tools** - [Mostly Implemented ✅]
   - ✅ Created TextureDebugger component for texture visualization
   - ✅ Implemented diagnostic tools for texture loading issues
   - ✅ Added togglable debug mode with keyboard shortcuts (D/T keys)

## New Priority: User Experience 🆕

1. **Performance Tuning** - [Needs Focus 🔍]
   - ✅ Implemented texture caching for improved performance
   - ⚠️ Need to optimize road segment rendering for large networks
   - ⚠️ Set up performance monitoring for texture loading/rendering

2. **Collision System** - [Not Started ⏳]
   - Implement basic collision boundaries for roads
   - Create road boundary visualization in debug mode
   - Add player-road collision detection

3. **Road Network Expansion** - [Not Started ⏳]
   - Create more complex road layouts with the existing system
   - Implement road network procedural generation
   - Add road features like intersections, curves, and junctions

## Blocked Tasks (Updated)

- ⚠️ Complex course layout (blocked by coordinate space standardization)
- ✅ Advanced road features (unblocked - texture rendering fixed)
- ⚠️ Dynamic road elements (partially blocked by debug visualization fixes)

## Task Dependencies (Updated)

## Implementation Notes

1. ✅ Texture rendering issues have been largely resolved
2. 🔍 Focus next on coordinate space standardization and debug visualization
3. ⚠️ Consider refactoring coordinate handling to use consistent conventions
4. ✅ Continue using TypeScript strict typing for all components and utilities
5. ✅ The debug mode toggle (D key) and texture debugger (T key) are working properly
