# CyclePath Development Tasks

## Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Project Setup

- Initialize a React project with Three.js (or react‑three‑fiber) and TypeScript.
- Configure the build system (Webpack/Vite) with live reloading.

### Basic 3D Scene

- Create a simple 3D scene with a grid, basic lighting, a camera, and a renderer.

### Player & Controls

- Implement a placeholder player bike (or object) with basic movement (keyboard controls) and an animation loop.

### Core Mechanics

- Generate basic obstacles along the course.
- Implement simple collision detection that triggers a game-over event.

### UI Overlay

- Add a basic start screen (with a “Play” button and minimal instructions).

## Phase 2: Alpha – Gameplay Expansion & Basic Polish

### Course & Obstacles

- Design a structured course that mirrors Mill Road.
- Introduce diverse, randomized obstacles and simple power-ups.

### Enhanced Controls

- Refine keyboard input and integrate a virtual joystick for touch devices.
- Add rudimentary balancing (e.g., rubber-banding) to keep races competitive.

### Audio & Visuals

- Integrate placeholder sound effects and a basic background track.
- Replace placeholders with improved, simple 3D assets.

### UI Improvements

- Develop a basic HUD (showing speed, score, distance).
- Update the start screen to include an interactive tutorial overlay.

## Phase 3: Beta – Feature Refinement & Increased Fidelity

### Visual & Audio Polish

- Replace basic models with detailed 3D assets and refined textures.
- Enhance lighting, particle effects, and overall scene fidelity.
- Upgrade audio to include polished sound effects and a locally flavored soundtrack.

### Expanded Gameplay

- Develop multiple levels with progressive difficulty, varied routes, and hidden shortcuts.
- Refine the power-up system by adding more items and corresponding animations.
- Implement a scoring and level progression system.

### UI/UX Enhancements

- Redesign the HUD and menus for better clarity, style, and accessibility.

### Performance Optimization

- Profile and optimize rendering, asset loading, and memory usage.

---

## Phase 4: Release Candidate – Final Polishing & Feature Completion

### Multiplayer & Advanced Mechanics

- Finalize multiplayer features (local/online) with stable connectivity.
- Implement advanced obstacle behavior and detailed collision responses.
- Add polished animations (destruction effects, item collection).

### UI Finalization

- Replace basic alerts with stylish modals for game over, level transitions, etc.
- Ensure full responsiveness and accessibility across devices.

### Testing & Optimization

- Conduct extensive user testing, bug fixes, and final performance tuning (targeting 60 FPS on desktop).

---

## Phase 5: Post-Release & Iterative Enhancements

### User Feedback & Analytics

- Monitor performance and collect user feedback.

### Content Expansion

- Develop additional levels, modes, and cosmetic items (unlockables, DLC).
- Plan seasonal events and community challenges.

### Ongoing Maintenance

- Regularly update the game with bug fixes, performance enhancements, and new features.
