# Staged Implementation Plan for CyclePath

## Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Objective:** Quickly produce a basic, functional version of the game that demonstrates core mechanics.

### Environment Setup

- [x] Set up the project using React and Three.js (or react‑three‑fiber) with TypeScript.
- [x] Configure the build system (Webpack/Vite) and ensure live reloading is working.
- [ ] Implement basic error handling for game initialization and rendering issues.
- [ ] Ensure the game canvas scales properly across different screen sizes and resolutions.

### Basic Scene & Controls

- [x] Create a simple 3D scene with a grid (or basic environment) and appropriate lighting.
- [x] Implement a basic camera and renderer.
- [x] Develop a simple player “bike” (or placeholder object) that can move forward and steer using keyboard controls.
- [x] Establish an animation loop that updates the scene in real time.

### Core Mechanics

- [x] Generate basic obstacles in the scene.
- [x] Implement simple collision detection that ends the game (e.g., show a “Game Over” message).
- [x] Add a very basic UI overlay (e.g., a start screen with a “Play” button and minimal instructions).
- [ ] Write unit tests for core components (e.g., player movement logic, obstacle generation).
- [ ] Test the game on multiple browsers for compatibility.

**Deliverable:**  
A working browser-based prototype where a player can start a race, move the bike, and experience a game over on collision.

## Phase 2: Alpha – Gameplay Expansion & Basic Polish

**Objective:** Expand core gameplay features and improve overall user experience while keeping the system functional.

### Enhanced Course & Obstacles

- [ ] Design a more structured course that mimics key sections of Mill Road.
- [ ] Increase the variety of obstacles (e.g., dynamic hazards like pedestrians and vehicles) with basic randomized behavior.
- [ ] Introduce simple power-ups (e.g., temporary speed boost, shield) with clear visual cues.

### Improved Controls & Input

- [ ] Refine keyboard input and integrate a basic touch interface (virtual joystick) for mobile devices.
- [ ] Implement rubber-banding or minor balancing mechanics to ensure races remain competitive.
- [ ] Optimize touch controls for mobile devices (e.g., gestures for steering).

### Audio & Basic Visual Enhancements

- [ ] Add placeholder sound effects (collision, power-up activation) and a simple background track.
- [ ] Replace placeholder models with improved basic 3D assets for the player and obstacles.

### UI & Feedback

- [ ] Develop a basic HUD displaying speed, score, and remaining time or distance.
- [ ] Update the start screen with a simple tutorial overlay.
- [ ] Provide clear in-game visual and audio feedback for actions (e.g., drifting, item pickups).
- [ ] Add basic accessibility options (e.g., colorblind-friendly mode, adjustable text size).

### Save/Load System

- [ ] Implement a basic save system to store player progress (e.g., high scores).

**Deliverable:**  
A more robust, single-player version of the game that is engaging and gives a taste of the intended “quirky commuter” experience.

## Phase 3: Beta – Feature Refinement & Increased Fidelity

**Objective:** Polish the game’s visuals, audio, and user interactions; add new gameplay layers and prepare for user testing.

### Visual & Audio Polish

- [ ] Replace basic models with detailed 3D assets that capture Mill Road’s character.
- [ ] Enhance textures, lighting, and particle effects for collisions and power-ups.
- [ ] Upgrade audio to include refined sound effects and an upbeat, locally flavored soundtrack.
- [ ] Incorporate voice commentary or humorous in-game quips.
- [ ] Add optional weather effects (e.g., rain, fog) to enhance immersion.

### Expanded Gameplay & Levels

- [ ] Develop multiple levels with progressive difficulty, varied routes, and hidden shortcuts.
- [ ] Refine the power-up system with additional items that play on the “psycho” theme (e.g., humorous animations, quirky sound cues).
- [ ] Introduce basic level progression and scoring systems.

### User Interface Enhancements

- [ ] Redesign the HUD for clarity and style; integrate smooth transitions and animations.
- [ ] Add additional menus for settings, level selection, and achievements.
- [ ] Optimize the game’s responsiveness across devices.

### Localization

- [ ] Add support for multiple languages (e.g., English, French, Spanish).

### Performance & Optimization

- [ ] Profile and optimize rendering and physics to maintain smooth gameplay on both high-end and low-end devices.
- [ ] Ensure efficient asset loading and memory management.

### Advanced Testing

- [ ] Write integration tests for gameplay mechanics (e.g., collision detection, power-ups).
- [ ] Conduct performance testing to identify bottlenecks.

**Deliverable:**  
A polished beta version ready for closed user testing with refined visuals, audio, gameplay, and UI.

## Phase 4: Release Candidate – Final Polishing & Feature Completion

**Objective:** Finalize all major features, integrate multiplayer if planned, and resolve remaining bugs.

### Final Gameplay Integration

- [ ] Complete multiplayer features (local and/or online), ensuring stable connectivity and minimal latency.
- [ ] Add advanced mechanics (e.g., dynamic obstacle behaviors, refined rubber-banding).
- [ ] Implement comprehensive collision detection and responses, including detailed destruction and item collection animations.

### UI & UX Finalization

- [ ] Fully polish UI components (menus, HUD, tutorials) and ensure full accessibility.
- [ ] Replace basic alerts with stylish modals for game over, level transitions, and victory screens.

### Testing & Optimization

- [ ] Conduct extensive user testing, gather feedback, and iterate on gameplay and performance.
- [ ] Finalize all code optimizations and ensure consistent performance (target 60 FPS desktop; smooth mobile experience).

### Analytics Integration

- [ ] Integrate analytics to track player behavior and engagement metrics.

### Tutorial System

- [ ] Add an interactive tutorial to guide new players through the game mechanics.

**Deliverable:**  
A release candidate version of CyclePath that meets all functional and non-functional requirements, ready for launch.
