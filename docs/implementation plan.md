## Code Style & Technical Requirements

All implementations must adhere to the Cyclepath coding standards:

1. **TypeScript First**
   - Use strict typing for all components and functions
   - Create proper type definitions in dedicated type files
   - Prefer `type` over `interface` except when extending

2. **React Component Structure**
   - Use functional components with React hooks
   - Follow single-responsibility principle
   - Maintain proper prop typing with optional/required distinctions
   - Implement error boundaries for 3D components

3. **Three.js Best Practices**
   - Follow React Three Fiber patterns for declarative 3D
   - Use `useFrame` for animations instead of render loops
   - Implement proper texture management and memory cleanup
   - Optimize using instanced meshes for similar objects

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Co-locate tests with components (`Component.spec.tsx`)
   - Use Vitest for unit and integration testing
   - Implement visual regression tests for 3D elements
   - Create test utilities for common 3D testing scenarios

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Manage texture memory appropriately
   - Implement proper object pooling
   - Use React profiler to identify component bottlenecks
   - Implement tree-shaking compatible code structure

### Debugging Road Segment Layout Discrepancies
